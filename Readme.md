# HiltPractise

This is a simple practise app for learning **Dependency Injection** using `Hilt`.
The sample app fetches a list of top ten crypto currencies & displays them in the `MainActivity`.
The `DetailActivity` shows a little bit more information of the selected currency.

The app uses the CoinGecko public api for showing data.

### TODO:
1. Use Jetpack Compose
2. Add some more usage relating to DI to learn more of Hilt
